LearnLib is a free, open source ([Apache License, v2.0][1]) Java library for automata learning algorithms.

About
-----
LearnLib is mainly developed at the [Dortmund University of Technology, Germany][2]. Its original purpose is to
provide a framework for research on automata learning algorithms as well as for their application in practice.

Please note that the development of LearnLib is still in a very early stage. The public version is a re-implemented
version of the former closed-source version of LearnLib. It does not yet have the complete functionality of the
original version. Features will be added and made available as time permits. On the other hand, everyone is
invited to contribute.

Also please note that many parts of the library have not yet been thoroughly tested.
